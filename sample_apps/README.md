# Sample Apps

This folder contains sample applications which use the graphQL API.

You can use these as references for building your own apps.

## Contributing

Please feel free to submit your sample application to be shared with the community following our contributing guidelines.

Your sample app should be in a folder using the naming convention of the language or framework and any other helpful descriptor. Be sure to include a README file in the root to describe the functions and setup of the app to get it running.

See [the contributing guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on how you can help.
